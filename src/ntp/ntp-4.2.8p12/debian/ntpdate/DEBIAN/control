Description: client for setting system time from NTP servers (deprecated)
 NTP, the Network Time Protocol, is used to keep computer clocks
 accurate by synchronizing them over the Internet or a local network,
 or by following an accurate hardware receiver that interprets GPS,
 DCF-77, NIST or similar time signals.
 .
 ntpdate is deprecated. Please use sntp instead for manual or scripted
 NTP queries/syncs.
